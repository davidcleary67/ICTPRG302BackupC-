Compile the C++ source code file ctest.cpp to the executable file ctest with the -g debug option

# g++ -g -o ctest ctest.cpp

Run the executable file ctest

# ./ctest

Set the permission on the executable file ctest so that the current user can read, write and execute it and everyone else can read it

# chmod 744 ctest

Debug the executable file ctest

Option 1 - Cloud9 debugger

a) Create a new Run Configuration

b) Set the runner to C++

c) Set the CWD to the appropriate directory

d) Click on the debugger icon to turn on the debugger

e) Specify as Command the full path from the starting directory, environment,
   to the C++ source code file followed by the list of all command line arguments
   
   Need to understand how to debug multi-file programs

Option 2 - gdb debugger

Start the gdb debugger
# gdb ctest

Gdb commands
$ run --> run ctest
$ run arg1 arg2 --> run ctest with arguments arg1 and arg2
$ b main --> set a breakpoint at the function main
$ b 20 --> set a breakpoint at line 20
$ info b --> list all breakpoints
$ next --> execute the next line, stepping into functions
$ step --> execute the next line, stepping over functions
$ until --> execute to the end of the current loop
$ print exp --> print the value of exp
$ where --> print the current location 
$ continue --> continue running the program in
