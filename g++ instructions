# ./ctest

Set the permission on the executable file ctest so that the current user can read, write and execute it and everyone else can read it

# chmod 744 ctest

Debug the executable file ctest

Start the gdb debugger
# gdb ctest

$ run arg1 arg2 --> run ctest with arguments arg1 and arg2
$ b main --> set a breakpoint at the function main
$ b 20 --> set a breakpoint at line 20
$ info b --> list all breakpoints
$ next --> execute the next line, stepping into functions
$ step --> execute the next line, stepping over functions
